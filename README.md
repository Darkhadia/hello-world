A repository to keep my ideas in one place

Well hello there, fellow seekers of the infinite knowledge-of-things.

I am actually studying part-time, at present studying maths and Java and have just joined up for a web development course to do in my down time. It was suggested I head to github to help in the web development side, so here I am!
